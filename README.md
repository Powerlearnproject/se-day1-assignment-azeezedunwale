Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principle, methods, and tools to the development of high-quality software systems.
It is important in the technology industries as it enable the creation of software application and systems that powers various aspect of our modern life including communications, transportation, entertainment, health care.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The milestones in the evolution of software engineering are:
-	The development of programming languages e.g. Fortran, C, etc
-	Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
-	Advent of structured programming in the 1970s
-	The rise of agile approach in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The phases of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) are:
-	Requirement gathering: This the phase we gathered user requirements and needs, system requirement requirements, and business needs. This is the planning stage of SDLC where all the 
  necessary ground works are carried out such as determining the feasibility of the project, the project timeline, budget requirements, risk analysis, etc
-	Design phase: At the stage, the system blueprint is designed such high-level architecture, user interface design, system components design and the overall system structure.
-	Implementation: It has the stage that the system design is converted to actual software code, and the use of version control is employed to track changes and enhance collaborations and 
  interactions among team members
-	Testing phase: This is the stage where various tests (unit test, integration test, system test, UI/UX test) are carried against established criteria or standards to ensure that the 
  software meets necessary quality and functional standards, and users’ requirements.
-	Deployment: This is the phase the software is introduced into the production environment for users uses. The activities here include software installation, configurations, user training etc
-	Maintenance: This phase is all about continuous monitoring of the software for any operation or technical issues, providing ongoing support, addressing and fixing any bugs and or enhancing 
  software features.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall approach to software development is a sequential and linear approach to software development that requires detail plan and well documented process at the beginning, usually adopted in a stable and predicted environment. Each phase of SDLC must be completed before moving to the next phase. It is the most suited approach for large project with no or little expected changes such as developing enterprise solution like bank application enterprise software, Government revenues collections enterprise solutions etc

Agile approach: Unlike the waterfall approach, this approach is an incremental and iteratives approach to software developments where the development is carried in small chunks and heavily dependent on customers feedback to enhance improvement. This approach is best suited for projects with changing requirements, and evolving industries. It is flexibles approach to software developments that encourages collaboration and flexibility.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: 
Software developer is responsible for the actual code developments and implementing software solutions. Software developer roles include:
-	Writing clean secure code
-	Follow best code writing standard
-	Interpret users requirements and design software solutions in line with user requirements
-	Debug and fix bugs
-	Communicate and collaborate with designers, Quality assurance officer

Quality Assurance Engineer:
The role of quality assurance engineer is to ensure that software meet quality standard and user requirements by benchmarking the software against predetermined criteria and standards. Quality assurance carry out various test, ranging from unit test, integration test, system test, UI/UX test, to user acceptance test to assure software quality. The role of quality assurance include:
-	Design and execute (manual and automated) test cases
-	Identify and report software issues
-	Work with software developer to resolve issue
-	Assure that software meets both functional and non-functional requirements

Project Manager:
Project manager is responsible for the overall success of the software development project by overseeing and managing project from planning, design, implementation, testing to maintenance, and delivery of the project on time, to budget, and to user requirements. Project manager’s responsibilities are:
-	Setting up the project goals, objectives, constraints, scope, and deliverables
-	Manage the resources (i.e. man, material, machine) of the project
-	Monitors and tracks projects progress
-	Facilitate communications and collaboration among stakeholders, and development project teams
-	Conflict resolutions among project teams and stakeholders

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): This is  the software application tool use by software developers to write code, debug code, fix software bugs and test codes. Common examples of IDEs are Visual Studio Code, Eclispe, IntelliJ Ideas, Pycharm, Jupyter Notebooks, etc

Version Control Systems (VCS): This is the application software used by developer to track and monitor changes in software sources code, facilitate effective collaboration and interaction among software team. Examples are Git, GitHub, Subversion, etc

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

The common challenges face by software engineers are:
-	Time constraints: The requirement to deliver project on time according to schedule or earlier to agreed time
-	Continuous changes in requirements
-	Technical debt either from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions can impede future developments efforts and lead to increase cost

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing: This is the test carryout to ensure that individual components or functions of the software application meet established criteria or functional standards. This test is carried out on the individual components in isolation.

Integration testing: This is the test carryout to ensure that different components or modules of the system works together and integrate effectively. This test is to ensure efficient interaction between the different modules or components.

System Testing: This is the testing carryout out on the system to ensure that it meets both functional and non-functional requirements.

Acceptance testing: This is testing to ensure that the system meeting business and user requirements. This is testing the system from user perspective.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering: This is the process of construction statements or questions to get the best possible response from AI model. It is a mean to influence and direct AI or smart assistance response to meet our precise needs. AI prompt must be clear, specific, concise and be within context.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: What is accounting?
Improve prompt: Explain financial accounting and tell me its uses in business
